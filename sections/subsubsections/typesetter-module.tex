The export functionality is handled by the save\_current method. To prepare for typesetting, the system converts the vector QPolygon data back into raster masks using cv2.fillPoly. The MangaTypesetter module then uses these masks to in-paint the background and render the final translated text onto the image. The result is saved a PNG file.
