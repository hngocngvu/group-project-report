The BatchProcessor manages the automated pipeline. Once a file enters the processing state, it undergoes three sequential steps:
First, the Segmentation stage is where the BubbleSegmenter (wrapping Ultralytics YOLO models) detects text bubbles. The system supports dynamic model switching via the application menu, managed by the ModelManager which downloads weights from HuggingFace if missing.
Next, in the OCR stage,  detected regions are cropped based on their bounding boxes and passed to the MangaOCRModel for text extraction.
Finally, in the translation step, extracted text is passed to the ElanMtJaEnTranslator. This model can also be swapped dynamically between varying sizes.
