The \verb|OCRTab| handles text extraction using the \verb|MangaOCR| model from \verb|manga-ocr|. 
The system iterates through the valid \verb|Bubble| objects, using their stored bounding boxes to crop specific regions from the source image for inference. 
The results are displayed in a \verb|QListWidget|. To prevent UI clutter, the preview text is truncated to 20 characters with ellipses. 
A \verb|QTextEdit| widget allows the user to correct the OCR output. The application managed the event loop by blocking signals during updates to ensure that the edits in the textbox immediately update both the \verb|Bubble| data object and the visual text overlay on the canvas without causing recursive event loops.
