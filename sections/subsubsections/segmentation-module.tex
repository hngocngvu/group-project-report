\verb|SegmentBubbleTab| manages the initial image acquisition and object detection. In this tab, the images are loaded via \verb|PIL| for backend processing and converted to \verb|QPixmap| for frontend rendering in the \verb|QGraphicsScene|. 
The module wraps the Ultralytics YOLO model. The users can load custom weights from a \verb|.pt| file and adjust the confidence threshold slider to tune sensitivity dynamically. 
The resulting detection masks are converted into QGraphicsPolygonItem overlays. The system binds the visual polygon to the logical \verb|Bubble| object by using \verb|setData(key, value)|. This linkage allows the system to identify exactly which data object to remove from \verb|AppData| when a user selects a polygon and triggers the delete command.
