The FileQueueList widget provides a drag-and-drop interface for batch input. It accepts image files (PNG, JPG, BMP) and wraps them into ImageProject instances. The list communicates directly with the BatchProcessor via signals, providing feedback on the status of every file in the list, highlighting errors in red and completed files with status text.
