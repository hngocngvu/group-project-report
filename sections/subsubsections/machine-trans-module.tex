The \texttt{TranslateTab} handles translation of text using the \texttt{ElanMT} transformer model. The model is lazily loaded when requested. Three models are available: \textbf{tiny}, \textbf{base}, \textbf{bt}. The interface shows a split view, a list of bubbles, and the read-only Japanese source text with their editable field for translated text.
