The \verb|ReplaceTab	| handles typesetting. It replaces the source text in bubbles with translated text using the \verb|MangaTypesetter| backend. Because the backend typesetter requires binary masks rather than vector polygons, the system implements a helper function, \verb|_polygon_to_mask|, which rasterizes the \verb|QPolygon| objects into Numpy arrays using \verb|cv2.fillPoly|. The engine paints a white background and renders the translated text over the original image using the generated masks. The final result is converted from a raw byte array back into a QImage for display and export to disk.
