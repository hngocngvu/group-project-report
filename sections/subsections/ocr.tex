To translate the visual content of speech bubbles into machine-readable text, we integrate the \textbf{MangaOCR} framework. While general-purpose OCR engines (e.g., Tesseract) struggle with the non-linear layout and unique typography of Japanese manga, MangaOCR is specifically architected to handle vertical text, \textbf{furigana} (pronunciation guides), and mixed writing systems.
