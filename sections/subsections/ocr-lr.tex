In text detection and recognition, Hirata et al. \cite{hirata2016comics} employed an image operator learning method generating binary segmentation in pixel level. 
Machine learning algorithms were applied to learn image operators from training images with ground truths, where windows are considered as features.
The choice for window value is important in this task, which can lead to large generalization error. Therefore, two-level operators were born to solve the problem by using moderate size windows for training and combining resulting images.
Later in 2018, Chu et al. \cite{chu2018text} proposed two approaches based on deep networks for text detection.
The first approach utilized multiple CNNs for feature extraction, joined them and fed to a combination of a classification and a regression network.
The other approach took region proposal, extracted features and classification/regression in a single deep network.
While previous studies primarily focus on developing specific text detection or segmentation methods, Soykan et al. \cite{soykan2024comics} provide a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework that offers a unified perspective on comics OCR and facilitates systematic comparison across different approaches.
