In 2017,  Rigaud et al. \cite{rigaud2017textindependent} proposed an adaptive thresholding method to binarize grayscale images and extract connected components, identifying speech balloons based on their content topology and alignment. In 2019, Dubray and Laubrock \cite{dubray2019deepcnn} employed a deep convolutional network with a U-Net architecture and a pre-trained VGG-16 encoder to segment speech balloons in comics. Later, Melista et al. (2021) \cite{melistas2021deep} combined Faster R-CNN for balloon bounding box detection with U-Net for pixel-level segmentation of speech balloons.
