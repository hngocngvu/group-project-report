The desktop application \texttt{Lucile} is designed as a modular graphical interface that acts as an abstract layer for a multi-stage machine learning pipeline. The application is built using Python and PySide6 framework, the official Python binding for the Qt project.

The system uses the data by sharing a single object during runtime. The \texttt{AppData} component stores \texttt{image\_path}, \texttt{Image} itself, and the results from each phase across the application's lifecycle.
