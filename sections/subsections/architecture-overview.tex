The desktop application "Lucile" is a multi-threaded graphical interface designed to wrap a machine learning pipeline for manga translation. Using Python and the PySide6 framework, the application separates the user interface from resource intensive inference tasks to ensure responsiveness.
The architecture uses a central MainWindow class that manages two background workers: ModelManager and BatchProcessor.
ModelManager is a dedicated module running in its own thread responsible for the lazy loading, initialization, and hot swapping of AI models.
BatchProcessor is an asynchronous module that monitors a file queue and executes the segmentation, OCR, and translation pipeline sequentially.
