The desktop application "Lucile" is designed as a modular graphical interface that acts as an abstract layer for a multi-stage machine learning pipeline. The application is built using Python and PySide6 framework, the official Python binding for the Qt project.
The system uses the data by sharing a single object during runtime. The \verb|AppData| component stores \verb|image_path|, \verb|Image| itself, and the results from each phase across the application's lifecycle.
