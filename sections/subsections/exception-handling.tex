All ML inference calls and file I/O operations are encapsulated in try-except blocks. 
A custom dialog class, \verb|MessageDialog| was implemented to handle runtime errors gracefully. Instead of crashing the application to the console, errors such as missing model files or inference failures are displayed in a pop up window.
