For translation, we used Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to convert the extracted Japanese text into English text. We utilised the 'elan-mt-ja-en' model series provided by Mitsua, which is built upon the MarianMT framework 
\cite{junczysdowmunt2018marian}.
The underlying architechture of the model family is a standard Transformer encoder-decoder network \cite{vaswani2017attention}.
