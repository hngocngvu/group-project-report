Early in 1986, Nagao et al. \cite{nagao1986mt} described the outline of Japanese to English machine translation system. 
In 2021, Zhou et al. (2021) \cite{zhou2021niutrans} introduced NiuTrans, built on variants of Transformer, Transformer-DLCL (Dynamic Linear Combination of Layers), ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation)-Transformer and vice versa.
Besides, back-translation, knowledge-distillation, post-ensemble and iteractive fine-tuning techniques were applied to improve model performance.
Later in 2024, Kinugawa et al. \cite{Kinugawa2024WMTNonRepetitive} reported the findings of the WMT 2024 shared task on non-repetitive translation, which is particularly relevant to dialogue translation scenarios where avoiding repetitive expressions is crucial.
