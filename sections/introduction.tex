Among recent forms of entertainment, digital comics have become increasingly popular due to their distinctive hand-drawn art styles and captivating story lines that appeal to readers of various ages. To make manga accessible to global audiences, translation plays a vital role.

However, the process is highly labor-intensive because translators not only interpret the text, but also edit comic pages using graphic tools, remove original dialogues, and replace them with translated content. While translation itself is already a demanding task, the additional manual work significantly increases both time and effort, leading to exhaustion, low efficiency, and quality reduction, which may impact readers' experience. 

With the advancement of technology, comic translation applications were born to support translators and improve workflow efficiency. They can reduce manual workload by automating tasks so that translators can focus on delivering high-quality translations. We propose an end-to-end application supporting professional translators by extracting speech bubbles and text automatically, along with assisted translation features. This work aims to bridge computer vision and natural language processing to perform automatic manga translation.
