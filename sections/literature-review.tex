%early approaches of each stage
Manga translation is not a new research topic since there are many publications working on automatic manga translation.
In 2022, Saikumar et al. \cite{saikumar2022automatic} presented an automated system for translating manga and integrating a multi-stage process into a functional framework.
Authors mentioned a common issue with Japanese while performing translation: Japanese lacks spaces between words and its word ordering in manga (from left to right vertically) are challenging to conventional OCR.
Another paper by Hinami et al. \cite{hinami2021towards} raised another difficulty in context understanding since a character can be divided up into multiple bubbles (narrations) and the order of speech bubbles.
